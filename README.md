nba-record-projection
=====================

Creates a record projection for each NBA team by taking the average of a team's RAPM and WP projection.

Each record is then weighted by the team's rest schedule, which applies penalties/rewards according to the number of games
they and their opponents play without more than 2 days of rest within a 4 day span.
